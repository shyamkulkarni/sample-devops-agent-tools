# Redshift Query Diagnostic Bundle

Produces ONE result set with all diagnostic data needed for query optimization.

## Instructions

1. Replace `<QUERY_ID>` with the slow query's query_id
2. Replace `'<TABLE1>','<TABLE2>'` with the table names used in the query
3. Run the query via the `execute_query` MCP tool — one result with 3 columns: section, key, value
4. Analyze ALL returned rows directly — no CSV export or manual sharing step is needed

## Query

```sql
WITH history AS (
    SELECT '1-HISTORY' AS section,
           key,
           value
    FROM (
        SELECT 'query_id' AS key, CAST(query_id AS VARCHAR) AS value FROM sys_query_history WHERE query_id = <QUERY_ID>
        UNION ALL
        SELECT 'elapsed_sec', CAST(elapsed_time / 1000000.0 AS VARCHAR) FROM sys_query_history WHERE query_id = <QUERY_ID>

## Helper: Find your query_id

```sql
SELECT query_id, user_id, SUBSTRING(query_text, 1, 100) as query_preview,
       elapsed_time/1000000.0 as elapsed_sec, start_time
FROM sys_query_history
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(hour, -24, GETDATE())
  AND user_id > 1
ORDER BY elapsed_time DESC LIMIT 20;
```
